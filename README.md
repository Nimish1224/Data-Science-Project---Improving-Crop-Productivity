# Data-Science-Project---Improving-Crop-Productivity
Data-Science-Project---Improving-Crop-Productivity - Jupyter Notebook Code

Objective
---------
* Agriculture is believed to be as backbone of Indian economic system. For the past few 
decades, agriculture field has seen lots of technological changes to improve better productivity.

* The world population grows steadily but the resources for crop production continuously diminish. 

* Therefore there have been considerable efforts to develop innovative approaches for 
sustainable crop production. Using prediction methods, farmers can enhance the productivity of crops.

* These methods are used to find the required quantity of crops, seeds, humidity, water level and other
  supplements.

** KEY WORDS :- Precision Agriculture, Weka, ZeroR Algorithm, Matplotlib, Predictive Analysis.


Proposed System
---------

* Motivation
    * For decrease the sufferings of people in agricultural field as like paddy culture by leaf disease detection and recognition process.

* The proposal
    * Preprocessing the input image
    * Detection and feature extraction of individual leaf
    * Recognition of the disease portion of paddy leaf

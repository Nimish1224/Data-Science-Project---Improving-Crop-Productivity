Data-Science-Project---Improving-Crop-Productivity - Jupyter Notebook Code

ABSTRACT
---------
* Agriculture is believed to be as backbone of Indian economic system. For the past few 
decades, agriculture field has seen lots of technological changes to improve better productivity.

* The world population grows steadily but the resources for crop production continuously diminish. 

* Therefore there have been considerable efforts to develop innovative approaches for 
sustainable crop production. Using prediction methods, farmers can enhance the productivity of crops.

* These methods are used to find the required quantity of crops, seeds, humidity, water level and other
  supplements.

* KEY WORDS :- Precision Agriculture, Weka, ZeroR Algorithm, Matplotlib, Predictive Analysis.


Proposed System
---------

* Data are collected for different weather conditions, soil, humidity, air quality, crop maturity,and statistics of previous few year data have taken under consideration and future will be predicted by using machine learning algorithm .

* Though previous monitoring techniques gathers the crop conditions properly, prediction results have not yet been optimized. First of all, researchers do not have clear idea about crop condition and crop monitoring methods . 

* They should know how to monitor crop condition on different circumstances. So crop characteristics should be well monitored by researchers to deliver good results in prediction methods.

* Basically problems in predictions are finding proper algorithm for prediction methods and assuming different location results for   predictions.
